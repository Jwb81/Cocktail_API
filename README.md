# Cocktail_API
An API to contact a database full of cocktail recipes and ingredients

The database is being hosted on mLab and it contains multiple collections:
    * recipes (for drinks that are already made)
    * ingredients (for all of the ingredients that are currently loaded in the machine)
    * users (for registered users and all of their data)
